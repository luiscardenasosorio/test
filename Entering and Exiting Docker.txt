Getting in and Out of DockerAfter initial installation, you will be in the docker environment. To Leave, use Ctrl + P+Ctrl+QYou will be back in the Host server. However, the docker container is still active. In order to terminate it use the following command:$ docker stop $(docker ps -a -q); docker rm $(docker ps -a -q); docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true)  docker network rm $(docker network ls -q)  sudo lsof -nP | grep LISTEN  sudo kill -9 1548Then, to run the docker container again, use this following command:$ docker run -v $HOME/immunedb_share:/share -p 5000:5000 -p 8080:8080 -it arosenfeld/immunedb:v0.25.1Keep in mind when there is a container active. If you try to run the command above without closing the container, you will get the following error: 	“docker: invalid reference format.	See 'docker run --help'.”To fix this, just run the first command.
